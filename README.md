# Welcome

A trading strategy implementation that reads data from both Alphavantage and 
Quandl for backtesting. Implemented is a 'buy and hold and buy more' strategy 
comparable to a fund savings plan using backtrader and custom feeds. 

The backtesting can help to identify whether executing saving plans on a 
specific day systematically outperforms other days in the month.
